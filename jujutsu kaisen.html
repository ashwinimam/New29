          <h1>JUJUTSU KAISEN</h1>
          <h3 ><i>
     *Jujutsu Kaisen* is a Japanese anime and manga series created by Gege Akutami that follows a hidden world where dangerous supernatural beings called Curses are born from negative human emotions. To protect society, jujutsu sorcerers use cursed energy and special techniques to exorcise these threats. The story centers on Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted high school student who becomes involved in this world after a sudden encounter with a powerful curse. Known for its intense action, strong characters, and darker themes about life, death, and fear, *Jujutsu Kaisen* has become popular for blending emotional storytelling with high-quality animation and a well-structured power system.</i></h3>

          <h2>SUKUNA</h2>
          <p><B>Ryomen Sukuna is a major antagonist in Jujutsu Kaisen, known as the King of Curses. He is an ancient sorcerer from over a thousand years ago who was so powerful that even after his death, his cursed energy lived on through his indestructible fingers. In the present day, he reincarnates by inhabiting Yuji Itadori’s body, sharing it unwillingly. Sukuna is ruthless, arrogant, and highly intelligent, valuing strength above all else, and he treats both humans and curses as inferior unless they entertain him. His presence represents pure, overwhelming power in the series.

               
Sukuna’s main attacks & abilities:

Cleave – A slashing attack that adjusts its power depending on the target’s toughness.

Dismantle – A precise cursed-energy slash used for opponents without strong defenses.

Malevolent Shrine – His Domain Expansion, which unleashes continuous slashing attacks over a wide area without trapping enemies in a barrier.

Fire Technique (Flames) – A powerful cursed flame attack he reveals later in the series.

Reverse Cursed Technique – Allows him to heal himself and even others.

Immense Cursed Energy & Combat Skill – His raw power, speed, and experience make him extremely dangerous even without techniques.</p>

     <h2><i>GOJO SATORU</i></h2>
     <P>

**Satoru Gojo** is a central character in *Jujutsu Kaisen* and is known as the **strongest jujutsu sorcerer of the modern era**. He is a teacher at Tokyo Jujutsu High and a member of the prestigious Gojo clan. Gojo is confident, playful, and often unserious on the surface, but he is extremely intelligent and deeply cares about protecting people and reshaping the corrupt jujutsu society. Because of his overwhelming power and rare abilities, both curses and sorcerers fear him, and his existence alone keeps the balance of the jujutsu world in check.

**Gojo’s main attacks & abilities:**

* **Infinity** – Automatically stops attacks by creating infinite space between him and opponents.
* **Limitless** – His inherited technique that allows him to manipulate space.
* **Six Eyes** – Grants enhanced perception and near-perfect cursed energy efficiency.
* **Blue** – A technique that creates a powerful pulling force.
* **Red** – A repelling blast with massive destructive power.
* **Hollow Purple** – A fusion of Blue and Red that erases everything in its path.
* **Unlimited Void** – His Domain Expansion that floods enemies with infinite information, overwhelming their senses.</P>

     <h2>YUJI ITADORI</h2>
     <P>Yuji Itadori is the main protagonist of the anime and manga series Jujutsu Kaisen. He is a kind-hearted, energetic high school student with incredible physical strength even before learning jujutsu. Yuji’s life changes when he swallows one of Sukuna’s cursed fingers to save others, becoming the vessel of the powerful Curse, Ryomen Sukuna. Despite this dangerous role, Yuji chooses to become a jujutsu sorcerer and fight curses to protect people and ensure they have a proper death. His strong sense of morality and determination set him apart from many other characters.

Yuji Itadori – Fighting Skills

Exceptional Physical Strength: Yuji has superhuman speed, power, and reflexes, allowing him to fight effectively even without cursed techniques.

Hand-to-Hand Combat: He is highly skilled in close-range fighting and martial-arts-style combat.

Cursed Energy Control: Yuji can reinforce his attacks with cursed energy to increase damage.

Divergent Fist: A technique where cursed energy strikes slightly after his physical blow, creating a second impact.

Black Flash: A rare and powerful technique that greatly amplifies the force of his attacks when timed perfectly.

High Durability: His body can withstand heavy damage, especially due to being Sukuna’s vessel.</P>

     <h2>MANGA VS ANIME</h2>
     <p>The manga is the original version of Jujutsu Kaisen, written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It presents the full story exactly as the creator intended, often with more detail and a darker tone. The anime is an animated adaptation that brings the manga to life with voice acting, music, color, and motion, making fights and emotions more intense and easier to follow.

Key Differences

Story & Detail

Manga: Includes more inner thoughts, explanations, and sometimes extra scenes.

Anime: Follows the manga closely but may shorten or slightly rearrange scenes.

Fight Scenes

Manga: Fast-paced and intense, but readers imagine motion themselves.

Anime: Highly detailed fight choreography, smooth animation, sound effects, and dramatic music—Yuji’s fights feel more powerful here.

Art Style

Manga: Black-and-white art with rough, sharp lines that give a darker feel.

Anime: Clean, colorful visuals with expressive character movements.
